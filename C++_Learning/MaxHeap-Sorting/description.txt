The goal of this assignment was implementing a MaxBinaryHeap that stores instances of std::vector<int>. In particular, the total order is defined on the sum of a vector's elements, and no duplicate vectors
(that is, vectors with the same elements) or vectors whose sum overflowed or underflowed should not be inserted. Further, a templated version of the MaxHeap can store instances of std::vector<T> as long as T is any numerical type.
Furthermore, three simple sorting algorithms as well as simple matrix multiplication were implemented, together with tests.

The code can be found in the src/ directory, and all file names essentially speak for themselves. The implementations of the MaxHeap as well as the sorting algorithms are located in their own subdirectories of src.
The constructed tests are located under tests/.
The project additionally contains a Makefile, which can be executed by simply calling make.
This will compile and execute all test files, as well as the main file, which contains a few small demos displaying the implemented functionality with examples.
