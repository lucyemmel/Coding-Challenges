A C-based implementation of the sorting algorithm Bogosort, which sorts an array by randomly replacing two elements and then checking whether it is sorted.
Exists solely for my own amusement and because of a stupid joke with a good friend.
(Also, the first entry in this Coding Challenges repo, for some reason.) 

The implementation will read the first 12 numbers (if that many are presented) from the file input.txt, assuming each number is seperated by newlines.
To prevent overflows, the implementation only reads the first ten digits of each number (or 9, if there is a minus sign to indicate a negative number).
